\section{Clique}

\begin{description}
	\item[Instance] A graph $G = (V,E)$ and a positive integer, $k$.
	\item[Problem] Does $G$ contain a complete subgraph with at least $k$ vertices?
\end{description}

\begin{thm}
	\begin{equation}
		\textsc{3-Sat} \le_{P} \textsc{Clique}
	\end{equation}
\end{thm}

\section{Cook Theorem}

\begin{thm}
	\textsc{Sat} is NP-Complete.
	\begin{proof}
		Sketch:

		Say we have an NP-hard problem. We need to map every proglem to this
		problem. To prove we have NP-hard, we need to prove that we have a
		problem that is verifiable in polynomial time, but takes more than
		polynomial time to compute.
	\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\section{VC to HAM Reduction}

Given an instance of VC, we construct a graph $H$ such that $H$ has a
Hamiltonian circuit iff $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$.

Suppose that $H$ is a seperate graph that overlays $G$ and the circuit in $H$
goes around each of the vertices in the cover.
