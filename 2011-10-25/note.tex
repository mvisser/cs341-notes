\section{Triangular Stuff}

How many triangles can we build with a specific base?


\section{Designing Efficient Algorithms}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Divide and Conquer
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Divide the problem into subproblems, solve them recursively,
				and combine.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item efficient
					\item sometimes difficult to implement
					\item overhead could be large
				\end{itemize}
			\item Hard to do runtime analysis
			\item Solved
				\begin{itemize}
					\item sorting
					\item multiplying numbers
					\item matrix multiplication
					\item closest pair
					\item linear selection
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Greedy Algorithms
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take locally optimal choice in each step
			\item Sometimes doesn't work
			\item Must prove that it works --- this is hard
			\item solved problems
				\begin{itemize}
					\item change
					\item scheduling
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Dynamic Programming
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Compute scores for subproblems organized in a large matrix
			\item Challenge to come up with the right subproblem
			\item Solved problems:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item General coin change problem
					\item Longest common subsequence
					\item knapsack
					\item Shortest triangulation
				\end{itemize}
			\item Not very good efficiency often
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Graph Algorithms}

The \textbf{degree} of a vertex $v$ denoted by $\texttt{deg}(v)$, is the number
of edges that meet at $v$.

We can represent graphs with pointers, but it's kind of gross.

We cal also use an \emph{adjacency matrix}, which has an $n\times n$ matrix,
where $n=|V|$, and mark non-zero at $i,j$ if $v_i$ ``points to'' $v_j$. If a
graph is undirected, it must be symmetric.
